        How to Make Grilled Pizza
      </h2>

      <ol class="steps">
        <li>Start a charcoal fire or preheat a gas grill to medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Combine 2 cups flour, undissolved yeast, sugar, and salt in a large bowl. Add warm water and 1/3 cup oil; mix until well blended, about 1 minute. Gradually add enough flour to make a soft dough that forms a ball and is slightly sticky. Knead on a floured surface, adding additional flour if necessary, until smooth and elastic but not sticky, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Divide dough into 8 portions. Pat or roll dough on a well-floured counter to about 8-inch circles; they do not need to be perfect.</li>
        <li>Brush both sides of crusts with additional oil. Using hands, lift each crust carefully and place on grill. Cook for 3 to 4 minutes until bottoms are lightly browned and tops look set. Using long handled tongs, remove crusts from grill and place on a baking sheet with grilled-sides facing up.</li>
        <li>Lightly add sauce to the top of each grilled crust, then top with mozzarella cheese.</li>
        <li>Carefully slide pizzas back onto the grill. Cook an additional 3 to 4 minutes until bottom crusts are browned and cheese is melted. Remove from the grill and serve immediately.</li>
      </ol>
